Clone this repository to your server and point Apache to `your_installation_directory/public_html`. Make sure the .htaccess is being used by setting `AllowOverride All` in your Apache website settings.\r\n\r\nChange `config/config.ini` to use your database settings.\r\nRun `install/db.sql` with your SQL installation to configure your database.\r\n\r\nThe folders `cache` and `public_html/assets/cache` should be writeable.\r\n\r\n## Admin\r\n\r\nThe admin panel is available at `your_website_address.tld/admin`, where you can login using admin/admin for username and password. From there, you can add guides, change the homepage looks and add series. \r\n\r\n### Adding accounts\r\n\r\nYou can integrate access to the admin panel with your own website's account system by extending `classes/Security/AccountProvider.php` and implementing the authenticate function. In the config file, set `accountprovider` to your own class's name. See `extensions/DemoAccountProvider.php` for an example.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
